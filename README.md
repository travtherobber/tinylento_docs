## what is tinylento

tinylento is a small, speakable programming language built around rhythm and symmetry.  
every construct has a mirror, every block has a clear end, and every operation reads the way it’s meant to sound.

two-letter ops. four-letter loops. deterministic left-to-right execution.  
the language is meant to be learned by ear as much as by sight.

## about this repository

this repository holds the official reference for tinylento.  
it’s the frozen specification for version 0.1 — the python-hosted interpreter — and the baseline for all future builds.

if you’re building tools, testing runtime behavior, or just learning how tinylento reads, this is where you start.

## usage

browse the markdown files directly on github.  
each page can stand alone or be read in sequence — from the design goals down to the grammar and examples.  
examples can be copied straight into the tinylento interpreter.

future versions will add host/runtime-specific references, changelogs, and version comparisons.

tinylento isn’t just written. it’s spoken.
